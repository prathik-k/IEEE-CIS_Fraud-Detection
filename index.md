 <b>Introduction </b> 
 <br>
According to Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 2019 from the Federal Trade Commission, credit card theft is one of the most common consequences of identity theft. In addition to negatively impacting consumers, merchants lost $9.5 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2019, with the sixth highest number of bad transactions reported in Georgia. Unsurprisingly, minimizing the cost of fraudulent transactions is critical, and several security companies have released public datasets to enable the development of effective fraud detection models. For this project, we will be using the IEEE-CIS Fraud detection dataset published by Vesta Corporation on Kaggle. Prior models on similar datasets have utilized rule induction and decision tree methods to identify fraudulent transactions. We plan to assess several of these techniques, and also attempt different methods of feature engineering/data reduction.
